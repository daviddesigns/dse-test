# Notes from the author

## Commits 
I accidentally botched the commit history on my original pass from being logged in on the wrong account on my computer. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 

For the sake of public anonymity, I reinitialized the git repo and recommited. There is a file at the root of this repo called `original-commit-history` if you would like to see a screenshot.

## Code 
I had a lot of fun being exposed to Elix and working with web components and shadow DOM for my first time! 

It did end up being a challenging learning curve for me under the 4 hour timebox. I decided to use my time focused on ensuring I touched at least one aspect of all the major concepts / acceptance criteria at play, as opposed to pixel perfection or a single component's perfection.

I used the C360 Card Group for this demonstration, and left the C360 Card as a "dummy" component.

Some of the concepts I did my best to demonstrate: 
* BEM / Syntax standards
* Token Usage & Styling Hooks
  * Someone PLEASE let me in on the secret to styling nth-child from a parent to a child in the world of shadow DOM üôÉ
* Custom attributes / properties that enable Accessibility adherance for consuming developers
* Documentation
* Some Storybook configuration and tweaking
  * I attempted Controls and Knobs(OG) but failed üòë
* Responsive / flexible design
