## About Buttons

Buttons should be used in situations where users might need to:

- submit a form
- begin a new task
- trigger a new UI element to appear on the page
- specify a new or next step in a process

### Button Vs Link

The HTML elements for buttons and links describe a very specific type of action that is going to be taken when they are used. It is important you know when to use which, as the distinction matters:

- Use a **link** when youâ€™re **navigating to another place**, such as: a "view all" page, "Jane Chen" profile, a page "skip link" etc.
- Use **buttons** when you are **performing an action**, such as: "submit," "merge," "create new," "upload," etc.
- An action is almost **always** on the same page
