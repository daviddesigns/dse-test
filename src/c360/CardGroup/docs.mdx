## Custom attributes available
| Attribute | Required? |  Type | Default | Description
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `headline-text` | Optional | String | - | Displays the string you provide above the group of cards in the form of a headline. |
| `headline-level` | Optional | String | `p` | Sets the DOM element used for the headline. Pass the semantic HTML element name without any brackets. |
| `headline-size` | Optional | String | `x-large` | Determines the visual size of the headline. Available options: `x-large`, `large`, `medium`, `small`. |

## Accessibility considerations

By default the headline above the group of cards will render as a `<p>` in the DOM.

We have exposed the `headline-level` attribute for you to control based on the semantics of the environment you use this component. The heading level should be passed a string representing the name of the HTML tag needed to be semantically correct for your document structure. i.e. "h1", "h2" "h3", etc.


## Other important notes 

* The C360 Card Group will occupy the entire width of its container, and divide the space evenly among the nested C360 Cards based on how many are present. 
* There is a fixed margin between each card.
* The cards will stack on small devices.
* The headline element is an underlying `<c360-headline>` component.
